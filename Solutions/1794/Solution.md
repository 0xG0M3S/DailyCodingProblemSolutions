We can predict the winner of the game before even playing the game ! Nim-Sum : 

The cumulative XOR value of the number of coins/stones in each piles/heaps at any point of the game is called Nim-Sum at that point. “If both A and B play optimally (i.e- they don’t make any mistakes), then the player starting first is guaranteed to win if the Nim-Sum at the beginning of the game is non-zero. Otherwise, if the Nim-Sum evaluates to zero, then player A will lose definitely.”
